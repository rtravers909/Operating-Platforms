# Operating-Platforms

# The client was the Gaming room,the game was called Draw It or Lose It. Originially it was only available on the android platform and the goal was to extend it to be a multi-platform game.

# This document explicitly outlines the pros and cons of each operating system and gives the client detailed information on what the best option would be to meet their developmrnt goals.

# The process of working through a design document greatly enhanced the development phase. The whole team had a clear understanding of the software requiremnets and the solutions to problems. It also helped with comuunication between the development team and the client. The process of writing the design also helped me to have an idea of how the code needed to be structured.

# If i coild improve this document i would focus more research into accessibility to know how the application would run on different devices and operating platforms. Maybe some users play using a touch screen, others with controllers, or others with keyboards. I would highlight how our game would work and any problems we might have faced.

# I interpreted the user's needs primarily by implementimng their requirements into the game. We made the game a web based apllication so that it could  be accesed by any device with an internet browser. We implemented methods to save team names in a database. Games could be searched and found through team names. We also designed the software so that only one game instance of a game could be played at once.

# The approach towards designing the software was first about understanding the clients requirements. Once we understood that we took a top down approach to how we would design the game.
